# Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the generated tables, we can extract relevant information to further examine the data and answer additional questions. For example, we can explore the correlation between the number of customers in cities and countries, determine whether the city with the highest number of customers is located in the country with the highest customer count, and identify potential seasonal sales patterns. Utilizing visualizations will enhance clarity and support deeper analysis.
